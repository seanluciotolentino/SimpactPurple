Running on a Cluster
=========================================

In order to run on a cluster, mpi4py (http://mpi4py.scipy.org/) needs to be installed on the cluster or server.  To run 4 communities in parallel on a single node of the cluster run the following at the command prompt of the worker node::

	mpiexec -n 5 python MainMPI.py
	
This starts 5 processes, 4 of which handle actions for a CommunityMPI object, and 1 which handles organization of the communities through the GlobalMPI object. To run on a cluster of nodes (not just a single worker), run the following::

	mpiexec -n 5 -host v1,v2,v3,v4 python MainMPI.py

Where v1, v2, v3, v4 are worker nodes where processes can be initiated. Note that you'll need to be able to log into (ssh into) these nodes without a password to work correctly.
